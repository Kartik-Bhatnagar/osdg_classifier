  “We are a Model Corporate Entity with Social Responsibility” is one of the vision statements of Bharat Petroleum

monitors all CSR projects.
 -  A robust governance structure with a dedicated team of CSR professionals strives towards identifying and 
implementing impactful social projects, which are in alignment with the areas specified under Schedule VII 

of the Companies Act, 2013 of which the Company takes up CSR projects largely in the five core thrust

  Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) has been deeply rooted with BPCL’s business strategy, thereby fostering 
inclusive and sustainable development for society with a strong focus on the neglected sections of the community. 

BPCL’s CSR initiatives are in line with the guidelines issued by Department of Public Enterprises and Ministry 

of Corporate Affairs, Government of India. For the last eight years, BPCL has been following an institutionalised 

approach in five core thrust areas, which are also key pillars of Sustainable Development Goals and significant

indicators for the Human Development Index i.e. quality education, water conservation, skill development, health 
and community development. The strategy balances identifying, implementing, sustaining and monitoring CSR 

projects to maximise the sustainability, governance and scalability.
  BPCL weighs its performance by its Triple Bottom Line contribution to building economic, social and 
environmental stability. Throughout its journey, BPCL has piloted several projects in the development sector Pan 

India. Outcome and impact evaluation have exhibited that projects have triggered positive results and established 

a sense of community ownership in the broader social context. Today, through an institutionalised planning 

process, partnership with expert agencies and effective community engagement, BPCL is ready for scaling 

them up across districts/geography. Just as BPCL has progressively scaled up its outreach, it has also steadily 

increased our spending while consciously keeping a balance between ‘Delivering & Spending’.
  BPCL provided a budget of 
`
 203.32 Crores in 2018-19 and has allocated the entire budget for various projects 
within the items enumerated in Schedule VII, which includes several initiatives of national importance. In addition, 
BPCL has also carried forward 
`
 146.87 Crores unspent budget from previous years.
  Against the above allocation of 
`
 203.32 Crores and carry forward amount of 
`
 146.87 Crores, an expenditure of 
`
 177.94 Crores was incurred. The shortfall from the stipulated prescribed spends is on account of the following 
reasons:
 1.  In the beginning of the financial year, BPCL had strategized to commit funds for major projects within 
identified thrust areas that were envisaged to begin in the financial year 2018-19 e.g. Affordable Cancer 

Care in Assam, Integrated Development Project in Gadchiroli, etc. As these are long-term projects, their 

expenditure will be incurred in the subsequent year.
 2.  Significant shared value creation in the development sector becomes constructive and concrete through 
efficient implementation partners, sustained long term and continued intervention. The majority of its 

projects span between one to five years. A number of projects were approved in the 2
nd
, 3
rd
 and 4
th
 
quarters of the financial year 2018-19 with implementation spread over more than one year. Furthermore, 

as per the Company’s CSR Policy, projects are executed in a project mode with payments being linked 

to achievement of key deliverables. The actual expenditure against approved projects rolls beyond the 

financial year. Hence, payments for projects committed during the reported financial year will be released 

over the subsequent months.
 3.  CSR as a practice has grown exponentially bringing with it an increasing demand of transparency. Over 
the years, BPCL has been focusing on continuous improvement in social, environmental and economic 

performance that are both measurable and sustainable. This is also reflected in its CSR projects due to 

an established diligence process for approving the projects. Hence, BPCL does not disburse funds on 

projects which are not ‘sustainable’ or not delivering ‘results’.
  To improve on the expenditure, BPCL has adopted a decentralised approach to expedite the processing of 
projects and has formed multiple teams at regional levels. These teams are being trained towards ensuring 

sustainable and impactful projects in line with BPCL Policy. The projects that have been approved by these 

decentralised CSR Committees will increase the overall expenditure on CSR in the subsequent months.
  As a responsible corporate, BPCL’s constant endeavour is to complete projects which have been initiated 
while ensuring the impact envisioned. In the process, funds may have to be carried forward, sometimes even 

reallocated. The CSR funds that were unspent in the year 2018-19, despite being allocated, for the reasons 

mentioned above, are being carried forward to the next year and will be rightfully spent/ reallocated as the case 

may be.
  BPCL commits to continue enabling inclusive growth as a core component of sustainable development through 
focused and proactive social projects. BPCL strives to align its CSR initiatives with missions of national 

importance and sustainable development goals.
7.  Responsibility Statement of the CSR Committee that the implementation and monitoring of CSR policy is in 
compliance with CSR objectives and Policy of the Company.
  We hereby affirm that the CSR policy, as approved by the Board, has been implemented and the CSR Committee 
monitors the implementation of the CSR projects and activities in compliance with the CSR objectives.
