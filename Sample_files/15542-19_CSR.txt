6. Reason for not spending the prescribed 2% amount  
 Despite the unprecedented challenges and pressure on the telecom industry, the Company had scaled-up various CSR 
interventions during the FY 2018-19 which resulted into increased CSR spending vis-à-vis previous financial year i.e. from INR 

245.37 Mn in FY 2017-18 to INR 458.40 Mn in FY 2018-19.  Additionally, the Company has also contributed INR 37.25 Mn 

towards various other charitable causes (disclosed as ‚other contributions™ in the above mentioned table) which are not covered
 
within the ambit of the provisions of Section 135 of the Companies Act, 2013. The aggregate CSR spending of the Company for 

FY 2018-19 (including other contributions) is INR 495.65 Mn. 
 The Indian telecom industry is passing through a very challenging phase and the Company continued to be under stress during 
the FY 2018-19. Despite all the adversities & challenges, the Company is committed to build its CSR capabilities on a sustainab
le 
basis and is also committed to gradually increase its CSR contribution in the coming years. The CSR spending is guided by the 

vision of creating long-term benefit to the society. The Company through its Board and CSR Committee is determined to beef 

up its efforts to meet the targeted CSR expenditure. With the strong foundation which has been established during the year 

alongwith the proposed scaling up of a number of its CSR Projects, the Company believes that it has made meaningful progress 

towards reaching the target in the coming financial years.
 Further, the Bharti Family has also pledged a significant amount towards philanthropy, which will step-up scope and reach of 
Bharti Foundation™s initiatives to create opportunities for the underprivileged and contribute to nation building. Plan is to s
et up 
a world-class University namely Satya Bharti University, to offer free education to deserving youth from economically weaker 

sections of society.
 Responsibility statement of the CSR Committee
 The Committee confirms that the implementation and monitoring of CSR Policy is in compliance with CSR objectives and policy 
of the Company.
