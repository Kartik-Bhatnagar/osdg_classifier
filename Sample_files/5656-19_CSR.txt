Directors™ Report
6.  The reason for not spending the prescribed amount for CSR (two per cent of the average net pro
Þ
 t of the last three 
Þ
 nancial years or any part thereof) 
is:
The Company has primarily identi
Þ
 ed various critical segments in the domains of rural and urban development, such as education, health, livelihood, art 
and culture and environment sustainability, including systemic reforms in agriculture and infrastructure development. The CSR a
genda of the Company also 
includes disaster response and rehabilitation. The Company undertakes its CSR activities through HCL Foundation which is a char
itable trust established by the 
Company. It is the intention of the Company that the stated objectives of its Policy are carried out in letter and spirit and f
or these reasons, the Company™s CSR 
initiatives have been identi
Þ
 ed, funded and monitored with a view to create a long-term and sustainable impact.
HCL Foundation has rolled out three key 
ß
 agship programs: HCL Samuday - a rural development program, working across agriculture, education, health, 
infrastructure, livelihood and water and sanitation and hygiene (WASH); HCL Uday - an urban development program impacting under
privileged communities 
including migrant workers and displaced people living in urban slums; and HCL Grant - a program which enables sustainable rural
 development by supporting 
NGOs doing path-breaking work across India in the thematic categories of environment, education and health. The NGO partners wo
rk with HCL Uday and HCL 
Grant on the respective thematic areas as mentioned in the table above.
HCL Foundation works very closely with the State Government in its development projects and also has MOU signed with the UP Gov
ernment. Through its 
joint efforts, it helps the Government to channelize its social and development schemes in chosen areas more effectively and ef
Þ
 ciently which have a signi
Þ
 cant 
positive impact on the outcome. Though this reduces the outlay by HCL Foundation to some extent but it is made sure that the fu
nds are utilized in the most 
diligent and productive manner.
 
Some of the capital projects undertaken by HCL Foundation have a long gestation period due to technical complexities, stringent
 procurement process, 
requirement of land from the government and community participation issues. Accordingly, the Company has spent 
` 
125.45 crore on CSR activities during the 
year, which is nearly 87% of the total amount which the Company was required to spend on CSR. 
The CSR spending by your Company has been exponentially increasing year on year, through development models that bring about la
sting change in the lives 
of marginalized communities. To substantiate, the CSR spending in 
Þ
 nancial year 2016-17 increased by over 250% from 
Þ
 nancial year 2015-16 and further 
increased in 
Þ
 nancial year 2017-18 by over 133% from 
Þ
 nancial year 2016-17. Even in the current 
Þ
 nancial year 2018-19, the spending has increased by over 
35% from 
Þ
 nancial year 2017-18.
As a socially responsible company, your Company is committed to continuously look for avenues to spend that could have a social
 impact and the CSR spending 
by the Company would further increase in the coming years.
7.  A responsibility statement of the CSR Committee that the implementation and monitoring of CSR Policy, is in compliance with
 CSR objectives and 
Policy of the Company.
We hereby declare that implementation and monitoring of the CSR policy are in compliance with CSR objectives and policy of the 
Company.
