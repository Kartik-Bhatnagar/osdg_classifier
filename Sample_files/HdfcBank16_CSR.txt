6. In case company has failed to spend the two percent of the average net proﬁt for the last three ﬁnancial years or any 
part thereof, the reasons for not spending the amount.
 Building upon and scaling up on various interventions initiated in areas prescribed in our CSR policy, we increased our overal
l 
CSR spend by 64 per cent from 
`
 118.55 crore last year to 
`
 194.81 crore this year, i.e. to 1.6 per cent of the average net proﬁt 

for the last three ﬁnancial years.
 Given the absolute size and the substantial increase in the magnitude of our CSR spend, it was important that we identify appr
opriate 
implementation partners and further strengthen our resources and systems to ensure that projects are executed effectively and 

have the desired impact. With the strong foundations that we laid towards this end in this year, and the proposed scaling up of
 a 

number of our CSR  Projects, we believe we have made meaningful progress towards reaching the target in the coming ﬁnancial 

year. 
7. A responsibility statement of CSR committee:
 Our CSR activities are guided by the vision and objectives as provided in our CSR Policy. We have also put in place a robust 
monitoring and reporting mechanism to ensure effective implementation of our CSR activities, in line with the requirements of 
Companies Act, 2013.
 A description of our current projects is included in the Directors’ report.
