# United Nations Organisation-Sustainable Developmenment Goals(UNO-SDG) Classifier
### Our model to classify the SDG is deployed here : https://share.streamlit.io/kartik-bhatnagar/osdg_classifier/main/main.py

(There we have just to write a report we need to classify OR we can upload a Report Text File OR we can use a Sample Report File to see the SDG classification done by our Model)
